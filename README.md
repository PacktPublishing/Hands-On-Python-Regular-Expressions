# Hands-On Python Regular Expressions [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Python Regular Expressions [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-python-regular-expressions-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Do you fear regular expressions (regexes)? Do you need to ace the next interview where you will be asked about the advanced usage of regexes? Then you need this course! Regexes are a very powerful tool when you need to deal with textual data. Python offers all the advanced features of regexes such as look-arounds, quantifiers, and commenting your regexes to help your colleagues.

In this course, you will learn how to apply regexes in your daily programming tasks in Python. This technique is used daily in programming projects such as web development, machine learning, big data, and cloud computing. This course will walk you through regexes while cleaning your dataset in your next big data project; you'll handle data validation or capture chunks of useful information from text.

By the end of the course, you will have a better understanding of all Python functions and will be able to apply regex concepts to real-life programming situations.
<H2>What You Will Learn</H2>
<LI> Master the use of regexes in Python
<LI> Master hands-on regex concepts such as anchors, quantifiers, character classes, captures, and more
<LI> Use Python functions to replace text content via regular expression patterns
<LI> Learn Python functions such as search, findall, split, sub, and match
<LI> Search, edit, and manipulate text with the power of regexes in Python

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This course takes a hands-on approach and will walk you through learning and using regexes in Python. You will use the Python REPL extensively to construct regexes. We will also build a small web application using the Flask web application framework. It will contain a user registration form and we will use regexes extensively to validate the data received via the form.

### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
Python 3.7 <br/>
Visual Studio Code <br/>
